# Mobile Device Usage and User Behavior Dataset Analysis
This repository contains an analysis of a dataset from Kaggle on mobile device usage and user behavior. The dataset provides data on app usage time, device types, and various behavioral metrics, allowing for the exploration of several interesting hypotheses regarding user habits and mobile device interactions.

## Hypotheses for Analysis
The following hypotheses are tested and analyzed using the dataset:

**Hypothesis 1:** As user age increases, daily screen time decreases.
To test this hypothesis, we examine the correlation between user age and daily screen time. By investigating this relationship, we aim to uncover insights into how screen time varies with age and how user habits may change over time.

**Hypothesis 2:** Android users consume more data than iOS users.
This hypothesis aims to determine whether there is a significant difference in daily data usage between Android and iOS users. Analyzing data consumption patterns between the two operating systems may reveal important insights into mobile data usage.

**Hypothesis 3:** The number of installed apps increases daily battery drain.
By analyzing the relationship between the number of apps installed on a device and its daily battery drain, we can explore whether having more apps installed affects battery life, and if so, to what extent.

**Hypothesis 4:** Male users tend to use more apps than female users.
This hypothesis explores whether gender influences the number of apps installed on a device. We examine the data to see if there are significant differences between male and female users in terms of app usage.
